1. Set variable i to 1
2. Start outer for loop: Repeat while i is less than or equal to 9
3. Set variable j to 1
4. Start inner for loop: Repeat while j is less than or equal to 9
5. Calculate j * i
6. Display j * i in the format "j * i = result" with a tab after each expression
7. Increment j by 1
8. End inner for loop
9. Move to the next line
10. Increment i by 1
11. End outer for loop
