1. Initialize iteration to 0
2. Do while iteration != 0
3. Prompt user to "Enter 2 numbers"
4. collect inputs
5. save as firstnumber 
6. save as secondnumber 
7. Calculate sum = firstNumber + secondNumber
8. Display sum result (e.g., "a + b = sum")
9. Prompt user "Do you want to perform another addition? (1 to continue, 0 to quit)"
10. Collect user response
11. Save response as iteration
12. End do-while loop
